//! Primitive profiler for the VP9 encoder hot path (`VP9_PROF2=1`, or
//! [`set_enabled`] from an in-process harness).
//!
//! `rdtsc` cycle timers keyed by a fixed set of stages, accumulated with per-stage
//! call counts into process-global atomics, dumped by [`dump`]. `rdtsc` (not
//! `Instant`) because the innermost kernels are sub-µs — `Instant::as_micros()`
//! truncates a 0.05 µs call to 0, which silently hid transform/quantize time in
//! the "glue" bucket. Every probe is a no-op unless `VP9_PROF2` is set. At dump we
//! measure the empty-scope `rdtsc` overhead and subtract `calls × overhead` per
//! stage so the millions-of-calls kernels aren't inflated by the instrument.
//!
//! Two ways to read the buckets. [`dump`] prints the human table at end of
//! encode; [`reset`] + [`snapshot`] give an in-process harness the same numbers
//! programmatically, which is how `video-tests/analyzer` takes a median over
//! repeated encodes. The stages are NESTED-inclusive (see [`parent`]) — unlike
//! the libvpx reference twin, whose stack-based profiler is exclusive by
//! construction — so the report subtracts children before comparing the two.
